# **Introduction**

### **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**

It is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step. The goal of the SDLC life cycle model is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the user’s requirements.

### **SDLC Models**

**1\. Waterfall Model**

Best for Small, well-defined projects with clear requirements.

**Phases:**

Requirement Gathering → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
| --- | --- |
| Simple and easy to manage | Rigid, no flexibility to accommodate changes. |
| Clearly defined stages. | Late-stage testing increases risks. |

**2\. V-Model (Validation and Verification Model)**

Best for critical projects like healthcare or aviation where testing is crucial.

**Structure:**

Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase (e.g., Requirements ↔ System Testing, Design ↔ Integration Testing).

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
| --- | --- |
| High-quality and systematic testing | Expensive and time-consuming |
| Bugs detected early | Not suitable for frequent requirement changes |

**3\. Iterative Model**

Best for projects where requirements evolve over time.

**Approach:**

Software is developed in small iterations, improving upon previous versions.

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
| --- | --- |
| Early release of working software | Requires frequent customer involvement |
| Less risk compared to Waterfall | More resources needed for multiple iterations |

**4\. Spiral Model**

Best for: Large, high-risk projects requiring frequent evaluation.

**Structure:**

Planning → Risk Analysis → Engineering → Evaluation (repeats in a spiral manner).

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
| --- | --- |
| Strong risk management | Expensive and complex |
| Allows changes at any stage | Requires highly skilled risk analysts |

**5\. Agile Model**

Best for: Dynamic projects with frequently changing requirements.

**Structure:**

Divides the project into sprints (short development cycles).

Focuses on customer collaboration and continuous delivery.

**Popular Agile Frameworks:**

- Scrum (Sprints, Daily Standups, Backlogs)
- Kanban (Visual Workflow Management)

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
| --- | --- |
| Quick delivery of features | Requires high client involvement |
| Adaptive to changes | Difficult to estimate time and cost |

**6\. Big Bang Model**

Best for: Small-scale projects with undefined requirements.

**Approach:**

No formal process: coding starts immediately.

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
| --- | --- |
| Quick and flexible | High risk of failure due to lack of planning |

**DevOps (Development + Operations)**
